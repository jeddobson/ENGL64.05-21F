So many times I heard your rhymes But you can't touch this I'm kickin the type of flavor that makes ya say you're too much Kris So feel the fire of the one they call the Mack Daddy the fire is what I pack and what I pack is real bad I like to grab a hold of your soul and never let go Till ya jump do the hump and say (Hoe) Now that's the state of mind I'm in, Huh with rhyme after rhyme I win
The Mack (The Mack) Known ta break 'em off somethin and lay In a bed of funk keepin ya speaker pumpin The miggada, miggada Mack came to get it warm Wear my pants to the back, that's my uniform
ya lil cream puff mack daddy wanna be keep dreamin cause a mack you'll never be So all of ya'll with them Doctor Suess riddles you can get the finger ( ) the middle

Caught you on the scope (the scope)! Peepin out my rhyme cause it's dope (it's dope)! And for you there's no hope My name (is what)! Daddy Mack baby Totally krossed out catchin all ladies the age I be I should be playin with toys But instead I put my head into makin ya make noise That's how I kick it that's my every day life and I rehearse to be sharp as a knife man
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messin with cause when I put my hand on a mic I start wreckin it They call me the D.A. double D.Y. M. A. C. there ain't another brother bad as me
