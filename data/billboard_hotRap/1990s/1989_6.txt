1989 % Big Daddy Kane % Smooth Operator % I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Well, excuse me, take a few minutes to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'ma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo, the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin' on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin' lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, to listeners and spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator
'Cause I'm so smooth
'Cause I'm so smooth
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin' many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin' hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose, abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, 'cause I'm a smooth operator
'Cause I'm so smooth
'Cause I'm so smooth
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Now girls, step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
'Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin' 'em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and let's get it on
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this, there's none greater
Sincerely yours, the smooth operator
'Cause I'm so smooth
'Cause I'm so smooth
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey, I'm makin' sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line bright as the sunshine
Attackin' like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know, step off
Competition, I'ma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator
'Cause I'm so smooth
I'm gonna give it to you
'Cause I'm so smooth
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Ah yeah, and you don't stop
Genuine for '89
And I still ain't half-steppin', peace
