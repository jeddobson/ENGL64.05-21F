1995%Goodie Mob%Cell Therapy
When the scene unfolds young girls
Thirteen years old expose themselves
To any Tom, Dick and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes hollin they got rank
See Sega aint in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas they trained assassins
To do search and seize aint knocking or askin'
Dem coming for niggas like me Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future, look it up where they said it
Aint no more constitution in the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel moments tear
Until air tight vents seat off despair
Dem say expect no mercy, fool
You should be my least worries, gotta deal with W-2's,
1099's unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
They claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me
Cause I can see the young bloods hanging out at the sto
Oh you know what else they tryin to do make a curfew
Especially for me and you the traces of the new
World order time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, this' gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then,
I wonder if the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Listen up, little nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know
I shouldn't smoke so much but I do with the crew
Everyday on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost after I lost
My best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds and ain't 16 years old
This shit has got to stop let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell
Under attack loc up folks they in the hood,
Got an eye on every move I make
Open your face to info you aint know cause it's kept low
How the new world plan reeks the planet without the black man
So what's your angle, try to separate me from the
Blood is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on tha rug the Citron Absolut
Has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Lookout for the man with tha mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over tha scanner to buy you dish now -
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss tha days of tha old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming POW!
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Think about it, use that tool between Your two shoulders
The brain cells...
