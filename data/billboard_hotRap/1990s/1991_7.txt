I stay hard like an erection, I'm burnin suckers who wear protection, now whose next when Ed's flexin I'm the bread, and you are just a crumb off Jerkin your jimmy but you still can't come off I'm from Roxbury, the 'Bury, but not the fruit y'all Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's bru-tal Hold my bone, in a zone that's neutral Soon to be large, the whole nine yards, but I ain't souped y'all Suckers be swearing that their staring is gonna scare me Look but don't touch, and if you do be prepared G to go out, just like your first day off punishment Da Bulldogs, Roxbury, and Boston is what I represent The Black United Leaders Livin Directly On Groovin Sounds At first you didn't know us, but know it's like, "Yo put me down" We didn't get in there so you can get in with us You wasn't down when we was ridin the bus So put on your Adidas, and STEP OFF.. I got to have it
No need for me to run away, brother put the gun away You want to take my life away as if we were in combat You can buy some new Adidas but you can't buy my life back Aiyyo whassup with that? Why is it like that? Let's stand together y'all... and fight that in our race To replace waste with a taste, just in case you can't face the place that you've been put in If you was my kid, for what you did you'd have a foot in right in your ass, another term's rectum Kids are having kids, they're not parents so they let them do things that shouldn't be done You're not a father cause you got a son unless you're taking care of him Crack... is more contagious than rabies Baseheads broads are havin basehead babies Now how that sound, not profound Black people unite, and let's all get down.. I got to have it
I'm not like anyone else, and in your shoes I couldn't be in The E unto the D unto the O ohh yes be G'n Da Bulldogs got pull dawg, incitin we be seein I don't want to, stand on a corner, I'm MCing Call me, a goody two-shoes, who's in the right shoes be I don't have to pump jumps or clock G's It's my turn to go, and I got the right-of-way You gotta fight your way to see another brighter day But that's another subject you like it or you love it Ja-ilers, get jealous, no push but I'ma shove it But regardless, when times are hardest I cleaned off the dirt, cause they needed a polish When you're in like food in your stomach, they want to stick witchu But when you're out like Elvis, they want to dick you But hey, that's OK, cause we kept on strivin and even when T lost his car, we kept on drivin You had your chance to advance, but you blew it Now ask yourself this question did you like the way I do it I got to have it
