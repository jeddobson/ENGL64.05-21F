Yo Jinx man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man All these girls simple man, who you think fit the category?
It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played Like I was made by matell But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male I rhyme about uprights upliftin the woman For that are superior to handle by any male Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know
You can't play with my Yo-Yo "Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out"
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam The earrings I wear are called dophins Check the booty, yo it's kinda soft and If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother) I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like But I'ma lady, who will pull a stunt though I kill suckas, and even hit the block So what you wanna do? Ya must play it wrong(ay yo) Cause to me, you simply can't get none You wetter, then a hotter ho in snow Tell em Ice Cube, (Ice Cube) No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo Suckas
What's yo name baby?
That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but know I'm not a dunkin As I rap, chilly chill bringin the funk and I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk and He'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin I may be buttercup, or even We had dinner, and know we drinkin Cisco Hit the slow jams, it's gettin cosy Your home alone, so now you gettin nosy Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace Hang up in my face, it's a sad case So who ya man dippin the dollars, what Yup, for puttin lipstick on his collar At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla But he'll slap ya, and sock ya, so why bother?
But if you come knockin at my do'(ay yo) I'll smoke you, tell em Ice (Ice Cube) You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
Fool, 1990 and stand sucka free, yeah Tell em what's up
Yo, I hope you realize one day That ya week is Monday threw Sunday So listen to my Y-O, heres my bio And next to me, ha, your not fly yo Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts Yo-Yo, is just tryna to stop ya Because the world ain't a big soap opera It only takes one punch to drop ya And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya But no, I'm not livin like that first Although I pack, a real small gat in my purse(right, right) But no, it's not to cause corruptions Just to fight back on the structions Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O Yo, should I tell em Ice (Ice Cube) They know what time it is
Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady Stompin to the 90s! For all y'all suckas Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it You Can't play wit my Yo-Yo
The simple to a methaphor, make someone to yell on To keep it at a latest while they're yellin, "more, more!" I am very versatile, changin my ways to diffrent styles Knowledge is the key, expense is for my backround Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel imperior Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior Should we jam and take the stand, and disback all the Men who know no more the slang, slang And thinks wit his ding-a-ling? I think it's time that we defeat And stand on our on two feet If we wanna live wit justice and harmony How many more rounds must I go In order to let my people know Times were hard, things have changed "Don't try to play me out"
Ladyyy("don't try to play me out") Yayyy, yay hey("don't try to play me out) Yay, yay, yay, yay
