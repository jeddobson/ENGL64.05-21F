Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
I got a funny feeling, honey That you're kinda digging me But every time you see me You seem to be ignoring me
I know your name, yes, I do Because your girls told me I know where you live, you want to bet Because your girls showed me
But I'll parlay And stay out of your way Figuring I won't be ignorant I'll catch you the next day
When I focus, I notice you Only move with a chosen few Irreplaceable, what's up With insatiable you
I never figured you For the quiet type On the down low The low profile type
I always thought you Was a rah rah mama Stirring up crazy confusion Causing drama
What's the matter, huh Cat got your tongue Or some mack got you strung Or maybe I ain't the one
I want to know cause if I don't It's gonna haunt me Yo, word up You got me thinking you want me
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
I'm standing, picking my brain Trying to figure your game What's your angle, tell me Where you're coming from
The whole picture is strange So I'm digging the frame Because I like what I see Yeah, and I want some
So tell me what's your plot What's your plan You're looking for A rubber to get got I'm not your man
But believe in me You want to be with me But you won't even talk to me To tell me what it is you see in me
I gotta hear it from you, girl, sometime The word got around from my crew In Brooklyn and in the boogie down Said you had a thing for me And what would it take for a date And wait, swing with me
I got your cards You're playing hard to get I'm long and I'm strong And if it's on I keep it soft and wet
Let me know cause if you don't It's gonna haunt me Yo, word up, you got me Thinking you want me
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
Hey, yo, hey, yo Look at all the cuties Swinging in the party Look at all the cuties Swinging in the party
I never stumble cause I mumble And I'm ready to rap You got me feeling like I'm sleeping And it's keeping me trapped
But still in all, you want to stroll And have a fella on layaway Fronting for nothing like it's Something for me to stay away It was your trip Scared a grip Because I'm losing it I did what's clear Had it in gear Now you're confusing it
I had the thought That you were caught And you were going steady Wasn't checking for me Cause you had a friend already
But I'm-a put it all aside Cause God is my guide Swallow my pride, stride And follow my guide
Let me know cause if you don't It's gonna haunt me Yo, word up, you got me Thinking you want me
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
Got me waiting, anticipating You got me thinking I want your love I'm trying to show you Really, really want to know you You got me thinking I want your love
