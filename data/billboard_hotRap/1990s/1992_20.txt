People Right about this time, stay loose Cool, chilled licks by one called, Arrested Development Say, come on, selectah, easy
See, I was resting at the park minding my own Business as I kick up the treble tone On my radio tape player box, right? Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see? Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating Investigation, maybe she was demonstrating But nevertheless I was pleased My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out Drinkin' the 40 oz, going the nigga route Disrespecting my black queen Holding their crotches and being obscene At first I ignored 'em 'cause, see, I know their type They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight And they see a young couple having a time that's good And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hairdo And the loud bright colors that I wear I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit And the outfit that I'm wearing, brothers dissin' it Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me? 'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me! See?
I am everyday people You see, I am everyday people
I told the niggas, "Please let us pass, friend" I said "Please", 'cause I don't like killing Africans But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube But I had to take the brother out for being rude And like I said before, I was mad by then It took three or four cops to pull me off of him But that's the story y'all of a black man Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see I am everyday people (everyday, yeah) You see, I am everyday people
The moral of the story is You better look very hard at who you step into 'Cause you might get killed, or shot, and it's not worth it Africans need to be loving each other, and unite
