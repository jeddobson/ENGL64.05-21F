Yo, what's up?
What's up, baby?

N****, where da f*** you at?
Mr. good dick, what you say?
I said: where da f*** you at?
What? How you feel?
How you say you feel?
I feel like you need to get home before yo' s*** be outside
You say you daddy to come through and regulate?
What? Put his thang down, what? It's all good
It could be four, five, or six
You bet' not be nowhere, laid up wit' no b****
You betta bring that home to mama
Don't be playin' and s***
If you get horny when you out, no need for eyein' them hos
Why eat a burger when you got steak and potatoes at home?
A short drive is all it takes
I'm just a phone call away
Ain't no excuses, mutha f***a, for you runnin' astray
I give it to you when you want it
Ain't no other's like mine
Yo' ex-b**** can't f*** with this
So don't be wastin' yo' time
The Indian, black mix, boy, like I told you before
And we can ay, yi, yi the fur rug on my living room floor
And ain't nan ho gon' bring it like you know I'm a bring it
And ain't nan ho gon' freak it like you know I'm a freak it
And ain't nan ho gon' shake it like you know I'm a shake it
And ain't nan ho gon' take it like you know I'm a take it
So don't make me come lookin' for you
Pull you outta some mix
Then turn around and bust you in yo' s*** for four, five, or six
I don't care if it's four, five, six, seven, eight in the morning
Boy, you better call me when you think you gettin' horny
I don't give a damn 'bout who you with
Just as long as you ain't givin' up my s***
You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all-night-stayer
All up in your sauce when you need your rocks off
Knock your socks off, baby
Off the chain in this b****
Have your wide a** open while I'm slangin' this dick
Got you lovin' this s***
Suckin' and f***in' this dick
Want to go and make some bucks for this dick
Fightin' all in the club for this dick
I'm that player that you chose
Long as you satisfied, baby, f*** them other hos
Just keep my p**** horny, so you can put it on me
Girl, you know I'm the only one who can satisfy your monkey
Ain't nobody gon' do you like I do
When I put this love stick inside you
Money man guaranteed to satisfy you
Have you open all night like a drive-through
So bring yo thang on so I can get my bang on
I hope you likes a good f***, because my game strong
And I ain't lyin', girl, you wouldn't if you could quit
I signs my name on that p****, Mr. Good Dick
That's my s***
Now, n****, what you gon' do?
Ugh, let me put this good lovin' on you
We can do everything that you want to
'Cause I like it real freaky, n****; don't you?
That's right, don't make no promises
Can't find none better than mama's is
Stay wet, stay tight, keep you comin' back
Go all night, feelin' right
You be lovin' that
Hell yeah, like want to make enough moves
F***in' you, boy, like I got something to prove
Runnin' loose; f*** it, n****, gotta pay dues
Make you want to tell ya boys all about whose
No talkin' now; come get the good s***
Make you never want to f*** another hood b****
Have ya breakin' off plans to come and lay me
Mutha f***a, don't ever try and play me
