1998%Will Smith%Gettin Jiggy wit it
Bring it
Woo
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Haha
What, what, what, what
Uh
On your mark, ready, set, let's go
Dance floor pro, I know you know
I go psycho when my new joint hit
Just can't sit
Gotta get jiggy wit it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride
DKNY all up in my eye
You gotta Prada bag with a lotta stuff in it
Give it to your friend, let's spin
Everybody lookin' at me, glancin' the kid
Wishin' they was dancin' the jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy, make it feel like foreplay
Yo, my cardio is infinite
Ha ha
Big Willie style's all in it
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)

Gettin' jiggy wit it

(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
What? You wanna ball with the kid?
Watch your step, you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama, uh, mama, uh mama, come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali, he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser
DJ, play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only bad chicks ride in my whips
South to the west to the east to the north
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off, go off
Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
In the winter or the (summertime)
I makes it hot
Gettin' jiggy wit 'em
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
850is, if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop?
Who else? Will Smith
Livin' that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me
Give it to me now, nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezey
Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attackin' 'em
I rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psyche, kiddin'
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust, the lady of my life she hittin'
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You? Tryna flex on me? Don't be silly
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na-na, na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na, na, na, na-na), uh, uh
