Open there! Oh, yeah Come on, come on Rock Mix Check it out Yeah Check it out
I testified My mama cried Black people died When the other men lied
See the TV, listen to me, double trouble I overhaul and I'm comin' From the lower level I'm takin' tabs
Sho nuff stuff to grab Like shirts and it hurts With a neck to wreck Took a poll 'cause our soul Took a toll From the education Of a TV station
But look around Here go the sound of the wreckin' ball Boom and Pound When I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
One, two, three, four, five Six, seven, eight, nine What I use in the battle for the mind I hit it hard Like it supposed Pullin' no blows to the nose Like uncle L said I'm rippin' up shows
Then what it is Is only five per cent of the biz I'm addin' woes That's the way it goes Then you think I rank, never drank, point blank I own loans
Suckers got me runnin' from the bank Civil liberty I can't see to pay a fee I never saw a way to pay a sap To read the law
Then become a victim of a lawyer Don't know ya, never saw ya Tape cued Gettin' me sued Playin' games with my head What the judge said put me in the red Got me thinkin' 'bout a trigger to the lead
No no My educated mind say "Suckers gonna pay anyway" There gonna be a day 'Cause the troop they roll in To posse y'up Whole from the ground
Ready to go Throw another round Sick of the ride, it's suicide For the other side of town When I find a way to shut 'em down
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down
I wreck for respect Check one, hit the deck With the man of the hour Commit to soul power
For once I got to say shut 'em down on the regular Causing mass hysteria in your area Kicking it for my man Chuck D Down with PE On the remix Hung on the flix
So check it before I step down When I'm in your town You know I got to shut 'em down
Who count the money In the neighborhood But we spendin' money To no end, lookin' for a friend
In a war to the core Rippin' up the poor in the stores Until they get a brother Kickin' down doors
Then I figure, I kick it bigger Look 'em dead in the eye And they wince Defense is pressurized They don't really want it to be Another racial attack In disguise, so give some money back (yeah)
I like Nike but wait a minute The neighborhood supports so put some money in it Corporations owe They gotta give up the dough to my town Or else we gonna shut 'em down
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down) I shut 'em down (Shut, shut, shut, shut shut 'em down)
Yeah Oh yeah, one more time, here we go again Ah-huh, come on Hold it, come on Wait a minute now Hey, hey, hey, hey Yeah Hey, yeah, we got soul Hold the beat, hold the beat, the whole beat, y'all
