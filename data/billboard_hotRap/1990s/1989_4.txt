1989 % Fight the Power % Public Enemy  %
Yet our best trained, best educated, best equipped
Best prepared troops refuse to fight 
As a matter of fact, it's safe to say 
That they would rather switch than fight

1989 the number, another summer (get down)
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hitting your heart 'cause I know you got soul
(Brothers and sisters, hey)
Listen if you're missing y'all
Swinging while I'm singing (hey)
Giving whatcha getting
Knowing what I know in
While the Black bands sweatin'
And the rhythm rhyme rollin'
Got to give us what we want (uh)
Gotta give us what we need (hey)
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We got to fight the powers that be

(Lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
We've got to fight the powers that be

As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the pride's arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange
People, people we are the same
No, we're not the same
'Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say what is this?
My beloved let's get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
Bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
To make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be

(Lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
Fight the power (lemme hear you say)
Fight the power (lemme hear you)
We've got to fight the powers that be

Elvis was a hero to most but he
Elvis was a hero to most (yeah)
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight out racist that sucker was
Simple and plain
Mother f*ck him and John Wayne
'Cause I'm Black and I'm proud
I'm ready, I'm hyped plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look, bet you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for four hundred years if you check
Don't worry, be happy
Was a number one jam
Damn, if I said "You can slap me right here"
(Get it) let's get this party started right
Right on, c'mon
What we got to say (yeah)
Power to the people no delay
Make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

Fight the power (yes, yes, yes, yes y'all)
Fight the power (yes, yes, yes, yes y'all)
Fight the power (yes, yes, yes, yes y'all)
Fight the power (yes, yes)
We've got to fight the powers that be

What have we got to say? (Yeah)
Fight the power (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What have we got to say? (Yeah)

What have we got to say? (Yeah)
Fight the power (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What have we got to say? (Yeah)
Fight the power (come on)
