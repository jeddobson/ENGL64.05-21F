Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath (Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin' Aye, I'm gonna get somethin' to eat, dog Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga
With so much drama in the L-B-C It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G But I, somehow, some way Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day May I, kick a little something for the Gs (yeah) And, make a few ends as I breeze, through Two in the mornin' and the partys still jumpin' 'Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on And, they ain't leavin' til' six in the mornin' (six in the mornin') So what you wanna do? Shit I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too So turn off the lights and close the doors But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah So we gonna smoke a ounce to this Gs up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in Now this types of shit, happens all the time You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine Everythin' is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he Who listens, to the words that I speak As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?) She used to be the homeboys lady (oh, that bitch) 80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please Raise up off these n-u-ts, 'cause you gets none of these At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze Biatch, I'm just
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Later on that day My homie Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke Shit, this ain't no joke I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin' Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top 'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door And I'll be
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, biatch With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, biatch With my mind on my money And my money on my mind
