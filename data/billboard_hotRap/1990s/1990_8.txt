I've got the power 5power? power°
Hey, yeah-eah
Like the crack of the whip, I "Snap!" attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dig it like a cymbal, rhyme devil on the heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
7:14 a.m., wise, divine
Maniac brainiac, winnin' the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, getting kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
I've got the power (power, power)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
I've got the power (power, power)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I've got the power (power, power)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
I've got the power (power, power)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they are, "Snap!", don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
I've got the power (power, power)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
I've got the power (power, power)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I've got the power (power, power)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
I've got the power (power, power)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they are, "Snap!", don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
I've got the power (power, power)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
(You could break my heart, you could break my heart apart)
I've got the power (power, power)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I've got the power (power, power)
