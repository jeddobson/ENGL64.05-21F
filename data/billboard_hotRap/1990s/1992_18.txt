At the age of 19, heard the scene A lot of M.C.'s that do not come clean Fronting on dealing hard times in rhymes You see him in the streets and you see no signs Of the hell, and they get on stage and tell Some cornball war story, ring the bell (word) You're fakin' the funk Talking that extra hard junk, you're probably a punk And I'mma let you know, that this way You just don't cut with the artificial flow
Neek the Exotic breaks backs and necks When fakes try to front, they get smoked like blunts My rhymes penetrate like skunk Ayo word up, I think you're fakin' the funk
You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk)
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk)
You do a song about a current event Get on television and seem hesitant to represent And that's what we call fraud You can't kick the streets with a look I sold out a board (word) And everywhere has streets That's not trying to hear the same wack rhymes Over the same stink beats Cause times are real, and I can't feel Putting, down on the reel to reel
Now I'm a let you know With those weak style of raps, it's time to go I eject rejects that step I'm a vet ready to snap your neck I shine and rise at the same time The mastermind of the sport called the rhyme Now it's my time to dump chumps that front (Ayo Professor what's up?)
You're fakin' the funk
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk)
The era of the wack M.C. Is getting shut down when the Main Source stomps through your town 'Cause we don't play the role of a clown And keep things jumping with the real rap sound
So to all the people stealing beats (You're fakin' the funk) To the crossover rapper with the pleats (You're fakin' the funk) To all the chumps that's claiming the streets (You're fakin' the funk) Fronting incredible feats (You're fakin' the funk) To the girl acting like a prostitute (You're fakin' the funk) Wearing that hooker type suit (You're fakin' the funk) To the rapper with the big space suit (You're fakin' the funk) To the artist that doesn't pay dues (You're fakin' the funk)
'Cause, exotic and then you're torn with the hyper tone I can't be blown because my rhymes are hard like stone So prepare for the scare, because I'm you're worst nightmare, punk 'Cause you're fakin' the
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk)
