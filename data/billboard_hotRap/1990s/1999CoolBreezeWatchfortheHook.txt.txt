1999%Cool Breeze%Watch for the Hook
Never has every member in one crew been so diverse
Tryin' to outdo the last verse that I birthed that is my curse
Your knight in rhyming armor sentimentally slay all grand dragons
Grab the sharpest no. 2 then I'm stabbin'
Somebody let me a hold a no. 2 pencil 'cause they testin'
Somebody let me a hold a no. 2 pencil 'cause they testin'
I fly through the night, yeah
Mixing 'Card with some sprite, lyrics we put inside ya
Listen to these A T L riders
Keep your head straight, the street's full of snakes
Slithering, making deals, delivering
Uhh uh uh, that weed got you shivering
Paranoia, fifteen hundred go to the lawyer
After paying his rent, dollars and cents
They're stealing pit bulls, put up a fence
We movin' on, tell the crew it's on
'Kay, here it go
They call me Sugar Baby, Shi-da-loh
I'm one fourth of the mighty
G double O, D and the I and the E, the M and the O
Yo, this ain't no chain to your brain
Pistol and they gon' bang, plus drain ya
Like some Folgers [unverified] ya now
Get in touch with your clothes
Tellin' ya home, anybody disrespect my zone
We gon' get it on 'til we get it gone
And y'all might get it right but you gettin' in wrong
Or you gonna get shot and blown
Out here the volume workin' [unverified]
Stankin' cops get your skull split
And gettin' with it figuratively
It's just that I showed them now they tried roll out
Hopin' we'd be on, back in the weight room son
Think of a spot, we'd keep all day
Choppin' for the live spots
The thug, take your hairy soul like [unverified] I withdraw
Yeah, look here, been here
Dis here's, diss year's
Get one of the five
To lay it down round here
Gold and the platinum all over the walls
If you ever shake the hook, go and have big balls
Laid it down hard more than one fuckin' time
Go ahead and get it gone, now I'm out my mind
Went from hubcaps and 30's to the hundred spoke
People still talkin' 'bout the last rhyme I wrote
Eighty-seven was the year that I first stepped in
I'm hollerin' at Big D, doin' time in the pen, I say
Whenever the dope boys, done crept in
Steppin' all over your best friends
No wea-pons, the lyrical lessons
And smoked out sessions
The Young and the Restless
Some of the best in the Dirty South and Midwestern, hemisphere
They wanna be this here, the fate of be O I
Gonna run these verses and make you see this here
Niggaz, tried to jock it
I put my plug off in they girl's socket
Know, the D to the F is gon' forever rock it
Lock it, down
(Yeah, yeah)
The T stands for T-Mo, who's known as a teacher
Southwest young brother, bringin' the pain through your speaker
It's like a disease to fiend for the cheese you need
Come up and ease the feelin', exhibit and chillin'
While dealin' with the devil himself, increase my wealth be
More than tank tops the average minimum weight
College brethren, these days done changed the recipe
Steady taxin', creatively maximize, with proper investments
Can't be hesitant, with them dead president
Or you lose, or you could lose your [unverified] but no tools
For whateva time I got left, I'ma holla and scream D F
For whateva time I got left, I'ma holla and scream D F
I know a whole lot of brothers in the rap game
But most of them are in it for the shiny thangs
They wanna snatch all ten, maybe stack about fo'
They wanna live in the house but don't want no grass to grow
See what you need to do is learn the tricks of the trade
Go to work, put it down, and den get paid
It's only two of us gon' get caught for makin' the sale
I'm one, and if you the other bro, I can't tell
Ain't nobody think they come in, and get in the zone
Tryin' to kill fo' birds, with about fifteen stones
The see stands for Cool Breeze who's known as the champ
Freddy Calhoun, the coolest cutta at camp
Ay, my one's and my two's got your whole town shook
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook
