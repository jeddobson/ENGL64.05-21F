1991 % Compton’s Most Wanted  % Growin' Up in the Hood  % 

Wake your punk ass up The M.C Eiht's back in the motherfuckin' house Kickin' the straight gangster shit, for the 9, 1 You know what I'm sayin', gia
Growing up in the hood, yea boy 1984, was the year my peers didn't know, what was in store A little hard head kid came abade Time to pay my dues, learn the tricks of the trade
And at home it's the same ass story Mom's treatin' me like she don't even know me But my younger brother's got much clout I can't take this shit, so, I bones the hell out
And roll with the pack of wicked motherfuckers No shorts are taken, we're down black brothers A little nigga with no problems at all Fucked up and killed my first 8-ball
Quick up the stairs, so, little sucker stop lookin' Stagger to the house, so, I can collect my whoopin' But watch out 'cause a little nigga's up to no good Growin' up in the hood
Life ain't nothin but bitches and money 'Cause in the city you live and let die Nutting but bitches and money
I got hard times and will I escape, sometimes I wonder But, it just seems that the hood, that took me under Police sweat my tip and keep harassin' Trying to lock me up 'cause I keep on blastin'
Community tryin' to shut me out But the money keeps flowin' and I got much clout With the cluckers, the brother back street punk suckers Try to break me out fool, you be a short motherfucker
Always strappin', eager to peal a cap I set up a trap, put your foot to a nap 'Cause I grew up fast on the wrong side of the law So watch me take two to your jaw
Don't enter my hood, homeboy Not a Robocop, a robogansta, ready to destroy I take chances 'cause life to be ain't no good Growin' up in the hood
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost Nothin' but bitches and money
1987, I'm back on the scene, out of jail, I'm legit And I'm fuckin' up shit I'm ready to peal a sucker's cap And I heard that my hood was makin' snaps
As I precede to make my riches Just like the neighborhood kingpin, pimp, and all these bitches Task force tryin' to roll deep But, I'm playin' these punk fools cheap
Niggas rolled by and try to blast, it didn't work I seen the bullets flying and fool, I hit the dirt Bullets fly through the window Hits my brother, down goes my mother
As I'm rolling, I'm hitting my switches Looking for the punk ass, sons of bitches I found them, before I kill 'em, I said you fucked up good Gotta handle that, growin' up in the hood
Life ain't nuttin but bitches and money 'Cause in the city you live and let die Nothin' but bitches and money, yeah
A brother's on the run, I've got a hand in my stash box Wanted 'cause I'm serving them the potent fat rocks And my face is like a household name Everybody warns their kids about the dope game
But I'm still makin' my profit And the one time just can't stop it So, I keep hidin' my face No time to waste, they got me on the chase
Now, the neighborhood's on my line 'Cause some punk ass fool had drop the dime 5, O at my door, at 8 o'clock Rush to the toilet, so, I could flush the rock
Out the backdoor, freeze, I heard a shout Am I sure, yo, I guess I got no clout But it's murder one, I'm the victim, damn That ain't good, growin' up in the hood
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost Compton is the city that I claim City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure Compton is the city that I claim
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost Compton is the city that I claim City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure Compton is the city that I claim City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure
