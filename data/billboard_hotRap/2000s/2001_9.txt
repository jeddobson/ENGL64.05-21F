Dawg my project is sweetin'
But if you ain't from where I'm from, like some dawg
Don't come or you gettin' beatin'
Yeah we cheatin' dog that's automatic
We greedy, plus we try'n feed the needy dawg wit all the cabbage
Steal from the rich and give to the poor
We sell a few drugs, bust a few slugs, and pimp a few hoes
Don't let us find a bit in higgity
Dawg we turn them into stiggidies
With shorties off in riggidies
So if you ain't from here or wit my guys
Don't even roll through playa 'cause all the traffic gettin' minimized
Cries for help 'cause you got carjacked
Niggas roll for a minute then pass it to the hypes to sell the car back
And once she get it, it be stripped down
Thugs, they got your system and your dubs and want your crib now
Y'all betta' give the hood respect
'Cause it pay to play for a day up in my projects
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique
In my projects, my project thick

Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique
Now let me tell you bout them kingpins
Droppin' Y2K Benz on them rims, bringin' 15 in
They dishin' it out, they keep it in circulation
They dodgin' the Fedz, and suckas is playa hatin'
They got the whole hood stacked up
And now the po's walkin' on the showroom floor buyin' 'Lac Trucks
They stuck in the ghetto by choice
But if they go, it's jacuzzis and condos, with a Rolls Royce
Now voice your opinion
You heard about the 'War On Drugs'
Now won't you tell me who you think winnin'
Spendin money by the piles throwin' dubs,
On the 'burbans with the subs,
And they twerkin' bumpin' Coo Coo Cal
And the hood love hoodrats
On the bus-stop shakin it like it's hot with some good cat
Y'all betta' give the hood respect
'cause it pay to play for a day up in my projects

Dawg, go on and sum it up between the grind with dimes
Crimes and rhymes, y'all we comin' up
From sundown to sun-up, ha
The block watch, peekin' out the attic in case you run up
Wit diamonds and furs, he's and her's
Shoppin' sprees with ease to fill up a 2000 Suburb, ha
Dawg my projects got taste,
Although the rent ain't nothin' but two-fifty
We sportin five thousand dollar drapes
Makin' it happen, wit snappin to avoid that anchor
Hook me up with plenty tracks to keep a playa rappin'
So put my city on the map
Hook me up wit million dollar vocal cords,
I can afford a million on a track
You do the addin' and subtractin
Wastin' time just to figure out, without a doubt, that we stackin'
Y'all betta' give the hood respect
'cause it pay to play for a day up in my projects
