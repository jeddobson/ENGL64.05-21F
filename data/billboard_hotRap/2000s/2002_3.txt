Oh, hey Naughty
Oh, where's my kitty cat? Where's my kitty cat at?
Welcome to our party, sexy likkle shorties
"Written On Ya Kitten", lickin' lime from my Bacardi
Rub it on my body, kiss and twist and barley
Ask the don dada to do that song
While I, "Ooh ah, ooh ah", how I do that so long?
On the DL real baby, swell a dub crazy
Dj rewind that Naughty with that 3L Dub, baby (Dub, baby)
I move simple, just as sooth mix'll move gentle
I give ya mother, mh-mh, goose pimples goose pimples
Ain't the last brother, past lover
I be the bastard of the year
Y'know that calf punchin' back brother
N-A-U-G-H-T-Y, B-Y, Na-Na-Na-Nature
Not 'cause I hate ya
Master the matress, flip and fold backwards
One kiss on your cheek will make you backflip to Chadwick

Hey, ever since back in the day 
From, "O.P.P." down to, "Hip Hop Hooray"
Who invented party anthems that ease stress away? (Naughty, Naughty)
You got drama, never mind that

We got that flavor, make your hands clap, toes tap
And crossin' cultural and generation age gaps
Never can you fade that
We make your body like rock to this (Naughty)
Everybody's block party's gonna wop to this (Naughty)
So to the family here's another one ('nother one)
