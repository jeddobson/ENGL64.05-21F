2001 % Petey Pablo % Raise Up %

This is David Nevermind
And today's controversy is coming from yet another member
Or should I say members of the hip-hop community (Ayo, tell Fab we gon' get Playa)
(Nah, Playa's supposed to be here) Petey Pablo, a new artist signed under Jive
(Ayo, go get my homeboy) and has teamed up with Timbaland out of VA
In a quest to redeem his title (nah, we gonna blow this up) 
And bring North Carolina and Virginia to the front of the line (ayo)
(Yo, we gon' do it) we're gonna stand by
This one's for North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us
Yes, sir
North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us
Yes, sir
Who am I? Petey Pab' motherfucker
First to put it down for North Carolina
But guess what (what?), it's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point six (see the car)
Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go "eh-eh"
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about gettin' whatchu gettin' and drivin' all back here
Big fellas (six fellas)
Half of me and Carolina niggas done time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here (greens over here)
Pasqoutank, down on the, Odom East (lemme think)
Johnson County, Franklin, Burgaw, Newport, Warren, Shelby, Kenansville
(Man Currituck) Tarboro, Triangle, Goldsboro, Halifax, Statesville
And all my niggas doin' life behind the wall
This right here, right here, right here's for
This one's for North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us
Yes, sir
North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us
Yes, sir
You remember them days y'all, we used to play, y'all
The radio and put our own lil' part in the song, y'all
We used to (rep our city, rep our city)
Runnin' through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off
My house, my home, my hood
My brother, my sister, my cous'
My niggas that was there from the beginnin'
Been with me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all starin' at it
But it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been bein'
Y'all niggas just gettin' it, oh, it's a shame isn't it?
Oh, you thought we said we were comin' with a whole lotta somethin'
We were bullshitin'
This one's for North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us
Yes, sir
North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us, yes, sir
Man I had to do it
Just in case you were one of the ones
Who wanted to come and ask somethin' stupid
(What you think you doin'?) What it look like?
Puttin' it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothin' but a TT blast
That we got comin' atcha, (beats) slammin, (verses) classic
(Gold for this) what's after platinum?
(Baby, you a walking bomb) and I don't meant to scare y'all
But I'm about to bring it home
And blow these valleys, these hills
These streams in NC out the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em, "I told ya"
This one's for North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us
Yes, sir
North Carolina, come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina, come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us, yes, sir
Huh, af-after seeing this
I-I have no other questions, I, I mean I
Hey, look, this is David Nevermind
I'm signing off, but before I'm outta here, remember
If I'm ever caught with anything I'm not supposed to have, it's Nevermind
North Carolina and VA are definitely at the front of the line
You have my vote of support, over and out
Hey grandaddy, grandaddy
Read, read, read this right here, grandaddy
I can't read that shit
