Yea yea
All the game that you was spittin
You know that you was trippin
Never thought to see me dippin
But I had to keep missing
Tired of you stressing me
Why don? t you let it be
Come around testin me
F***n with me mentally
Goodbye
Don? t want to see your face no more
So long
Pack your bags want you out the door
Cause
Everytime that I play this raw game
Time and time again
It? s gonna rain
It? s gonna rain, it? s gonna rain, it? s gonna rain
Oh s***t there you go again
Flippin on me
One minute you the s***t
The next minute you s***ttin on me
So what? s the problem huh?
No wait, let me guess
Just give me some space
And some place to get a load off your chest
Or better yet
You don? t get enough attention at home
And when I? m gone I don? t even think to pick up the phone
I? m dead wrong
Now your fed up
Packin my stuff
F***n my head up
And I see it in your face right now
You wish I? d shut up
Really dont know what you came here for
Round and around we go
I'm sittin' your bags outside the door
Round and around we go
If you don? t understand where I? m comin from
Then my heart is telling me you? re not the one
All the games you? re playin, now your lies
You? re not the one for me no more so baby bye-bye
Pack your bags and get to steppin
You gotta let it go you need to stop trippin
I hope you don? t think I? ma let you back in
Cause you? se a fool
Don? t waste your time
Fooled me once
But not a second tiiime
Now it? s time for you to go away
I packed your bags nothing else for us to say
But. Byeeee
I was gutter when you met me
Gutter when you left me
Gutter when you came back
Face it, nothing can change that
Not romance or marriage counselin
You dropped the ball now I? m bouncin
Find me a room burn up an ounce in
Waitin for my baby to call
Forgive it all
Or some break-up, some make-up s***t
Givin me draws
I adore mi amore
But everytime she choose to go to war
I? m lookin at the front door
Today I made up my mind
To get away
Every day, I sit and pray
Everyday, everyday
Toooday I made up my mind
To get away
Every day I sit and pray
Everyday, everday.
