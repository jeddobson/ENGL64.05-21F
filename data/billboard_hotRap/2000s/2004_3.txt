Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I aint even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop man we do shit for fun
You aint got one nigga you betta run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin down I'm breakin down what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none
Now, e'rybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(E'rybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, e'rybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(E'rybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, e'rybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21, girl, that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin' with them fries
If so baby can I get 'em super sized
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick, so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of one lifestyle, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do
Now, e'rybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man, I ain't tryna get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, "Kwon, put out them trees"
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.
