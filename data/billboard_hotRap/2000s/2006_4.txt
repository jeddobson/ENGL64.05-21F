Dro, I'm clean in this bitch

This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich

I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist

Triple black Phantom nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms diamonds man, but nah, it ain't Flip
Hey bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork an' beans
Everybody know me in the club 'cause they smokin' me
Dro, hoes scopin' me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black and white Chevy now I'm ridin' Dion
Put them lights off in my rims now I'm ridin' neon

I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though

First I let my wheels spin then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How can I pimp a hoe? Take a bitch to Berlin
My bitch break niggas after that we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cockin' hammer, Arm and Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimpin' in linen and Salamander sandals
Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta, show niggas with ammo
We ride Phantom, holla shawty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET, out the channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin', bitch, I ride glazed on the Haze
Gator green Chevy, gator guts, Alligator J's
