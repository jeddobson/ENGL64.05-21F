And uh, it's going down (yeah, uh)

My man Bow Wow (Bow Wow, yeah, hear me now)
Yeah, ya heard? (Check it out)
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! (Peep game, let's go)
Around here we pop them collars
Around here we get them dollars
Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla
This kid here all about stackin' up
Talk big here but we can back it up
Long 'cause everybody get crunk
When it drop and the club starts acting up
I represent the S-O-S-O, D-E-F-M-O-B 
That's me, JD, Brat, and JE
So please believe
What I do ain't never been done
Ohio is where I'm from
I heard what you said and I saw what you do
And y'all players really don't want none
From the day to the night, I rock
Say what you like, never not
Stay in the light, livin' the life
Got's to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop, ridin' good 
Twenties, TVs, leather and wood
Poppin', watchin' Big Momma
Holdin' it down like a player should
Sing-a-long now!
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor 
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap-clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor 
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap-clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
It's the B to the O-W and you, wow
Even your girl fall in love when I smile
The type of little guy you ain't seen in a while
Ignore the height, just right for you size
I get in where I fit in
Braided up, paid the bucks and I'm still a kid
Imagine what life like when I get big
I'ma be rich surrounded by chicks
Couple of cars, couple of cribs
Gettin' a couple mill
Shinin' every time I feel
You see how So So get ill
You don't want no stuff up in here
Bow to the Wow, flavor in your ear now
I get down 'cause I'm hit bound
And I rock an iced out Mickey Mouse around my neck
And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter with his arm in the net
And I oughta snatch up your daughters
But I was brought up with respect
When I turn sixteen I'ma call her though
And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her 
Go and fall in love with a nigga, like me along time ago
Sing-a-long now
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor 
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap-clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor 
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap-clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
I, I, I wanna to see you bounce with me now
Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now
Shake, shake, shake it all around the town with me now
What ya gon' do shawty? What ya gon' do?
