How you ain't gon' fuck? Bitch I'm me
I'm the god damn reason you in V.I.P.
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi Ali
Blaow, we ain't got nothin' to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry 'em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are reckless
Feels like a midget is hangin' from my necklace
I pulled up wit' a million trucks
Lookin', smellin', feelin' like a million bucks
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smokin' that Cheech and Chong
What's wrong? The club and moon is full
And I'm lookin' for a thick young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get 'em outta them pants
Take note to the brand new dance, like this
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
When I move, you move

Hell yeah, hey DJ brin' that back

Go on wit' ya big ass, lemme see somethin'
Tell ya little friend, he can quit mean muggin'
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at wit' my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door and break 'em in
The owner already pissed 'cause we sorta late
But our time and our clothes gotta co-ordinate
Most girls lookin' right, some lookin' a mess
That's why they spillin' drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wantin' to put hickies all over ya chest
C'mon, we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth, brin' the party to life
Don't be scurred, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system the harder the fight
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
When I move, you move

Damn right the fire Marshall wanna shut us down
Get us out so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from gettin' some cutta
Now we one song away from tearin' da club up
Move over, Luda got somethin' to say
Do it now 'cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work wit' me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry 'bout me steppin' all over ya feet
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
When I move, you move
(Just like that)
Hell yeah, hey DJ brin' that back
