Ain't no shame ladies, do your thing

Picture blacks sayin', oh yes'a massa
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute Man, Big Red can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask you
When I come out, you won't even matter
Why you act dumb like ugh, duh
So you act dumb like ugh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum, pa-pom-pom
