Hey, Jim
You know the old sugar dad
They be trickin' they tell them girls
I said, you can have whatever you like
I said, you can have whatever you like, yeah
Stacks on deck, Patr贸n on ice
We can pop bottles all night
Baby, you can have whatever you like
I said, you can have whatever you like, yeah
Maybe I can treat you so special so nice
I gas up the jet for you tonight
Baby, you can go wherever you like
I said, you can go wherever you like, yeah
Any time you want to pick up the telephone
You know it ain't nothin' drop a couple stacks on you
You want it? You can get it, my dear
Five million dollar homes, drop billions I swear
Yeah, I want your body, I need your body
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I buy it
Tell them other broke joker "Be quiet!"
Stacks on deck, Patr贸n on ice

Shawty, you the hottest, I love the way you drop it
Brain's so good could've sworn you went to college
$100k deposit, vacations in the tropics
'Cause everybody know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet
Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket
5'6", drives with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade; you can get what I get
My chick can have what she want
And go in any store, buy any bag she want
I notice you ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desires like that
Yeah, I want your body, I need your body
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I buy it
Tell them other broke joker "Be quiet!"

Let me put this big boy in your life
Girl, you smell so fresh and look so nice
Let me put this big boy in your life, that's right
I want your body, I need your body
