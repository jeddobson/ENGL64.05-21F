Usher (Lil Jon, Ludacris!)
Yeah man, once again it's on (it's on)
You know we had to do it again right?
(We had to do it again boy!)
Uh-huh, uh, yeah
(I want you to sin' to these ladies man)
Uh, oh-oh-oh 
I guess I'm up first, let me at 'em
Uh, oh-oh-oh
Check me out, let's get it
Baby, how you doin'? Hope that you're fine
Want to know what you got in mind and I
Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here Patr√≥n and it's gon' be on
V.I.P done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up callin' it a night
She should holla at your girl tell her that you're shakin' the scene
Pulled off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, "Oh, I'm ready to ride" (I was like) Yeah
'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind
Don't mean to sound impatient but you gotta promise baby, oh
Tell me again (tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (oh, I gotta know baby, oh yeah)
Tell me again (make sure you're right, oh before we began)
That we'll be lovers and friends (oh, oh it's a good look baby)
It's a really good look baby, look here
Sometime wanna be your lover, sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug you, hold hands slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable
I could be your bud you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark then we both make up 
I do, anythin' just to feel yo' butt 
Why you, got me so messed up?
I don't know but you gotta stop trippin'
Be a good girl now turn around and get these whippings 
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back 
Here's a pillow bite that
And I'll be settin' separate plays
So on all these separate days 
Your legs can go they separate ways
Tell me again (tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (oh, it's a good look baby)
Tell me again (tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends (make sure you're right before you choose)
I's been knowin' you for a long time (shawty)
But fuckin' never crossed my mind (shawty)
But tonight I seen somethin' in you (shawty)
That made me wanna get with you (shawty)
You ain't been nothin' but a friend to me (shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (shawty)
Up in here kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' (shawty)
Up in the bathtub rub-a-dubbin' (shawty)
Are you sure you wanna go this route (shawty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shawty)
I would never ever cross the line (shawty)
Shawty let me hear you tell me one more time
One more time
Tell me again (tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (oh, it's a good look baby)
Tell me again (make sure you're right, oh before we began)
That we'll be lovers and friends (tell me over and over and over again)
Ah, ah-ooh, ah, ah-ooh
Ah, ah-ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Please tell your lovers and friends
