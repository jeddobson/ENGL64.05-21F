[Verse 1]
Yeah, one time for them Southern boys
Y'all boys can't mess with us

While we drive outta town, doin' thangs in them Navi' trucks
Got major dough, y'all boys be hatin' yo

Bust shot till ya drop ya know (bah bah bah...)
T nasty, I don't think y'all ducks wanna see me
Cuz it's sweet till ya see P, letcha girl watch while I pee-pee
Drank Henny, smoke trees, have her feelin' like ecstasy
I represent for my southern playaz
Hell with all them other playaz
Choked out with my brother playaz
Choke, choke, pass it around - pound for pound
Round and round, where'd it get down
H-Town, lay it down, tote big thangs round
One time for the underground
Trees for days, freaks to play, M-I-A
Lay back and switch the days
Still piss on the chick, while the girl kiss on the stick
Southern Hospitality clique, that's real boy
Slow down, ya need ta chill boy, down south we get ill boy
Come on!
