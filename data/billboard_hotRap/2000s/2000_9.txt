C'mon (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, now get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Uh, yo, yo, yo
What's with the melodrama?
Fella's wanna hover in my cypher like a helicopter
Like it's a special honor
The stealth bomba, gem droppa
Make the ghetto holla, intercontinental
Takin' you high like sky divers
When we spark with live wires
Original, cavemen quest for my fire (what?)
Express my desire to drop this new shit (c'mon)
These record executives keep tellin' me y'all stupid
Now if they right, shut the fuck up
Revolutionary, throw your guns up
Whether you a bougie broad who actin' stuck up
Or some ignorant thug motherfucker shootin' the club up
We gon' make y'all feel this (uh), break y'all spirit
If y'all fake that realness, word, we bringin' it
Ringin' it in from the new millennium to way after that
I call these cats Reynolds 'cause they plastic rap
Kill all the yappin' let's make it happen (c'mon)
You cats ain't real, y'all just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say action you start fakin'
I start breakin' (what?)
The whole joint start shakin' (c'mon)
This ain't the time or place for you to prove somethin'
Cut the stargazin', yo, move somethin'
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Word, alright bring it back to the top
To be continued (uh)
Let's see what's next up on the menu run up in you (uh)
Lyrics that be fuckin with you
In the mental, pick any mental, instru', funda', detri'
Extra, extra large like the borough of Brooklyn the residential
Existentialist specialist
Like Sly Stone wit my poem and fly song
Ride along with cats who live great and die strong, word
We gonna rock 'til nothin' else matters (uh)
Y'all catch bodies, we catch excellent cadavers (uh)
Your next of kin an' shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we peppermint Altoids
Step in the high reppin' the spot called Flatbush
Whether rappers or actors you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity (word)
Kill all the yappin' let's make it happen
You cats ain't real, y'all just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say action you start fakin'
I start breakin' (what?)
The whole joint start shakin' (c'mon)
This ain't the time or place for you to prove somethin'
Cut the stargazin', yo, move somethin'
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Move somethin' (move somthin')
Move somethin' (word)
Flatbush, Brownsville
Bed-stuy niggas, move somethin'
Chi and West Side niggas, move somethin' 
Cincinnati in the house, you got to move somethin'
My niggas in the Dirty South got to move somethin'
The South Bronx, 125 niggas move somethin'
Q Borough make it live, niggas, move somethin'
Miami all the way to Philly got to move somethin'
Chicago and the Brick City got to move somethin'
My Soul Rebels in the world you got to move somethin'
B-boys and B-Girls got to move somethin'
