Timbo, hey, Ne-Yo
Say what? Loso, hey
I'm a movement by myself (oh)
But I'm a force when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself (oh)
But baby you, you make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better
You plus me, it equals better math
Your boy a good look but she my better half
I'm already bossin', already flossin'
But why have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin'?
You're keepin' me on my A game
Without havin' the same name
They may flame
But shorty we burn it up
The sag in my swag, pep in my step
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppes
Guess it's a G thing whenever we swing
I'ma need Coretta Scott if I'm gon' be King (ooh)
I'm a movement by myself (oh)
But I'm a force when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself (oh)
But baby you, you make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better
First thing's first, I does what I do
But everything I am she's my improve
I'm already bossin', I'm already fly
But if I'm a star, she is the sky
And when I feel like I'm on top
She give me reason to not stop
And though I'm hot
Together we burn it up
The caked up cut, the cleaned up ice
When shorty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo, Batman and Robin
Whoever don't like it, is that man's problem
And when I feel like I'm tired
Mami be takin' me higher
I'm on fire
But shorty we burn it up
I'm a movement by myself (oh)
But I'm a force when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself (oh)
But baby you, you make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better (you make me better)
You make me better
