A-town, late night, fell off in 112 
posted up as usual downstairs
With a couple of Clydesdales, sippin' Zinfandel
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale
Blaze up, hate to ball and bail
Got some late cut, she sure know how to shake her tail
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up
And leave her man, make up
And cheat again, caked up
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend, come on
All these lonely girls wanna fuck, it's ok
That's alright girl, that's ok
That's alright girl, that's ok
Keep callin' me and pagin' me 
And blowin' me up, it's ok

She said I love my man, man, man, man
We got ours up and down 
and I'll get lonely and, and, and, and
Wanna move, move to someone 
who might understand, stand, stand, stand
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland
wonderland, wandered in, wanderin'
if she can go home with guilt on her mind
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine
After day you met her, better tell her, fore' another feller
Pet her kitten, sittin' sittin', chittin' chittin'
spittin' spittin', hittin' hittin' (woo, woo, woo, woo)
