Yeah, uh, my name is
Hair nappy but I'm happy pocket full of dough
From the C-O representin' So So
The girls recognize and these niggas do too
I'm the flyest thing walkin' through junior high school
So make room next to your little Backstreet poster
'Cause Bow Wow's here and it's over, ya heard?
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
In the big body shotgun ridin' on dubs
I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya'll know, I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets
All hear niggas sayin' is
Bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
And all my girls around the world 
That love how it's goin' down, say
Bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
And all the girls around the world 
That love how it's goin' down
Now that the gates wide open it is I who they runnin' from
Little with the ill, cross over like Iverson 
In 2K, my way, I'm the first to rock
First to drop, lights in the bezel of a G-Shock
Like B.I.G. and Pac, I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worse, I'm just gettin' started
Yeah that's me, that's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah that's me, that's got her arguing with her friends about
Who gon' get me when they see me 
Sayin', "Do you see 'em? Ooh, he the man" 
Thirteen, game lock, don't trip, all that and a bag of chips

With Lil' Bow Wizzy, this shit is off the hizzy
I threw him like a Frisbee and, yeah, he came back
Like a boomerang, Dogg Pound gang
Hundred thousand dollar chains (yeah)
What you say J.D.? (Bling, bling, money ain't a thang)
Ya ask me again and I'ma tell you the same 
I'm flippin' on these niggas while I'm trippin' on these niggas, man 
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
You standin' on the wall, nigga bust a ho (bust)
But you can't trust a ho, that's good game (I can't trust her)
Now all my niggas represent your thang 
Put it up, now click-clack it up
