11 years old, makin' A's and B's
And these lil mommy's can't keep their hands off me
When you see me in the streets holla "what's up doc?"
I gotta a bugs bunny chain with a matchin' watch
I make you jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation, I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy, but live a big man's life
I got girls passin' up wanna be my wife
I got grown women wanna be in my life
By the time I reach 18 I'm not gon be nothin' nice
I'm that R-O-M-E-O, and after high school
I'm goin' straight to the pro's bounce, bounce

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Uh uhh too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
(Heheh) O-kay
 Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your... girlfriend

Soldier boy I want u to myself
I don't want them girls around
Your the flyest thing up in here boy
And that's why it's goin down
I heard they call you Romeo
Well I'm your Julliet
U must be playin hide and seek
Cause boy your hard to catch

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Uh uhh too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
(Heheh) O-kay
 Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your... girlfriend
