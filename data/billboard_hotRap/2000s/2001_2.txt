Baby, if you're ready
I can give you what you looking for
I guarantee once you stay with me you'll want no more
And baby, if you want it
You can get it once we close the door (ooh)
You know it's something 'bout rolling wit' a G like you
Khaki's, French braids wrapped up, all keepin' it true
In the G, yes, when you see us, we on dub
Any BS that wanna see us, get domed up
A-team's on the hang like you bang for years
Main bitch and I ain't switch, bring 'em to tears
High pitch, like Eddie Kendricks when you hit an appendix
His and her's semi's regulate the problems we finish (what? What?)
Taught me how to grind, separate my nickels from dubs
G wit' it when you winning, so I'm showing you love
Had to check a broad yesterday for grilling you down
Shut it down quick 'cause me still wanna see these rounds
Any beef you got, trust we gon' eat it together
Hold it down in the hood while I get this cheddar
Whether it's all grits or gravy, yo, we ready to tangle
It's all G-heavenly, so you labeling me your angel
Baby, if you're ready
I can give you what you looking for
I guarantee once you stay with me you'll want no more
And baby, if you want it
You can get it once we close the door (ooh)
You know you chose the best when you singled me out
I got these cats at close range, I'm contagious to these lames
We broke game, it's time to kill game, I feel your pain
They wanna stretch you for some change
Never worry boo, I'm not gon' change
It's gon' still feel the same
Besides you said you done with with them games
It ain't no love loss
I hollered that you know you're in, that's leadin' the cause
Boss bitch, and I can put that on the cross
I'ma bang for you, and we gon' pull through
So when they release you from them bars
We gon' look up at the stars, notice the hood stars
They moving inside us, to get us it's gotta meant war
And as for them broads, you know the rules
It ain't a chicken alive that can walk in my shoes
I payed dues, they see the Bentley pull up, brand new
What the fuck? They better get on the bus
Remember the dreams about the house up on the hill
Spinning the bottle, quarter mil' (quarter mil')
Baby, if you're ready
I can give you what you looking for
I guarantee once you stay with me you'll want no more
And baby, if you want it
You can get it once we close the door (ooh)
I got a fetish for thugs, rugged with mean mugs
When he lonely, he phone me to please 'em
Jeans saggin', foot size twelve, like "oh, damn"
As he unclothed my mind froze, like "oh, man"
Underestimated, but so what, it's just a faded
Call it how I see it, shoot the game, I'm tryin' to play it
So into you and your Davison House shoes
To flip a yay and choppin' bricks
It figures beyond six
In and out, incarcerated, departed and used to hate it
He couldn't wait 'til you hit the gates to get activists ready
Your type is what I'm diggin', gossip heard, obsolete
Plans occurred on the sneak, swing surperb and unique
Keep it pimpin' and tight, addicted like all night
Eight inches, six pack, dig that, it's alright
That G or a that X burn like opium
He's a straight trophy, and grip tight, I'm holding on (ohh)
Baby, if you're ready
I can give you what you looking for
I guarantee once you stay with me you'll want no more
And baby, if you want it
You can get it once we close the door (ooh)
Here's another one, yeah
Doggy's Angels
And this is a Dog House production
My dawg, Battlecat, yeah
It's how we do it, y'all
Woof, ha ha
Bow wow, bow wow, bow wow (bow wow, bow wow)
