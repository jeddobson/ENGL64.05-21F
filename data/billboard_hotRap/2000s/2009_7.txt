2009 % Drake % Forever %

It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nuttin to play with,
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
And your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If i was at the club you know I ball'd, chemo,
Drop the mixtape that sh-t sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah n-gga i'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness,
B-tches,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
Ever ever, Mr West is in the Building,
Aint no question who about to kill em,
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my d-ck inside this life until that b-tch came,
I went hard all Fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a n-gga blow up they gon build statues of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin,
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these n-ggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you f-cking wasn't,
Your'e such a f-cking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,

Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn he snapped,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
Ok, hello its da martian,
Space jam Jordan's,
I want this sh-t forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If i had one guess than I guess im just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like i'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top",
Life is such a f-cking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the King talk, check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention,

Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Ssshhh, my foots sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last- huh,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
There they go, packin' stadiums
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic whoa,
We can make them look like bozo's,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
F-ck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This sh-t is exactly what the f-ck that i'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin with a few true villians
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback muthaf-cka for the way that you doubted me so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm hannibal lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face,
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time Im through with this place,
So Drake...
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
