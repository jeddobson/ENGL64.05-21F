Uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'?
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills (yo, yo)
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve 
Roll up on you like Christopher Reeves (oh)
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (whoops)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (ah)
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryna rap again (oh)
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out (come on)
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cause the X is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all, dawg, with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (ew)
Yeah, I think I did too much (uh-huh)
This substance equals cups (uh-huh)
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills (that's ill), Mescaline
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'?
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, some, some, something, something
Something, something, na-di-na-na (I don't know, fuck it)
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk (oh)
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okie-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aw, poor baby, born by a whore lady
Now I gotta strangle an (you're crazy), ha
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any shrooms?)
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs, because our arms show tracks (trace)
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked (oh)
If you like smack (uh-huh), then I might too (Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you (ew)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums (uh-huh)
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'?
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at rave, lookin' like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-headed guy
Heroin, Mescaline, pencil leads, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah, right) bitch, I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
