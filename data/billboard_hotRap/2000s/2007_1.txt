We fly high, no lie (you hear that?), you know this (ballin')

'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin')
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin')

Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)

A hundred G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossy)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin')
I made the whip get naked (what happen?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (got her)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem)
One am, we was at the club (what happen?)
Two am, ten bottles of bub' (money ain't a thing)
And by three somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

You talkin' buck-eighty if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a fly the Spur (where?)
To the hood and roll dice on side the curb
Now I know G-Bent may sound absurd (get your money up)
Drive eighty up Lennox 'cause I got a urge (speedin')
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous livin' in the fast lane (ballin')
So when I bleep shorty, bleep back
Louis Vuitton belt where I'm keepin' all the heat strapped (loaded)
