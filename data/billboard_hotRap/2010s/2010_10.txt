Uh
Let's pull the two-seater out, baby
It's wherever you wanna go
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (Rozay)
Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night (all night)
Breezing down the freeway, just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know (uh)
But here goes nothing
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the walls
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My dime bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside, get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time, pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms, whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in a rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when you get it out of state
Need a new safe 'cause I'm running out of space
Elory Jetson, I'm somewhere out of space
In my two-seater she's the one that I would take, we
Vibing to the music, this is how we do, it all night (all night)
Breezing down the freeway, just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know (uh)
But here goes nothing
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about the money bags
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul takes a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thang keep calling
Fuck maintain, boy, I gotta keep balling
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch, one hunnid
Vibing to the music, this is how we do it, all night (all night)
Breezing down the freeway, just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know (uh)
But here goes nothing
Aston Martin Music, Music
Aston Martin Music, Music
Aston Martin Music, Music
Aston Martin Music, Music (in our ride)
Aston Martin Music, Music
Oh, all night
Aston Martin Music, Music
Oh, in our ride
