[Bruno Mars (B.o.B):]
Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah...)
Nothing on you, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothing on you babe, nuh-nothing on you)

[B.o.B:]
I know you feel where I'm coming from (from)
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done (done)
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun (the uh)
On the carousel, so around I spun (spun)
With no directions, just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
And so I lost more than I had ever won (What?)
And honestly, I ended up with none (Huh?)

[B.o.B:]
There's no much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
(Something that you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go (go!)
Go (Go!) Go (Heeeeey!)

Yeaaaaah

[B.o.B:]
Hands down, there will never be another one (nope!)
I been around and I never seen another one (naaaah...)
Look at your style they ain't really got nothing on
And you out and you ain't got nothing on (Ha ha!)
Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop... - Now think about it

[B.o.B:]
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even went out there to Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show (steal the show)
And just like that girl you got me froze (got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (sixty-fo')
If you never knew, well now you know (know!)
Know (Know!) Know (Heeeeey~!)

Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing yo' name (name, name, name, name...)
And no matter where I'm at, girl you make me wanna sing (sing, sing, sing, sing...)
Whether a bus or a plane (plane), or a car or a train (train)
No other girls in my brain, and you the one to blame
