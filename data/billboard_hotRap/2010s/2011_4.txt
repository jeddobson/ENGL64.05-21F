2011%Big Sean%My Last%

Hands up in the air
I just want the, I just want the baddest b-h in the world
Right here on my lap
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma I'ma, hmm, hmm, like it's my last
(Boi)
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
(Boi)
Like I, like I, like I never had it at
Boi, boi, hey, okay
Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask
'Cause I'ma drink it all like, like it's my last
She a 7 in the face but a 10 in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this muthfucka
I'ma need the baddest broad to twirk off in this muthafucka
I'ma go hard until it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'ma boss, so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
And I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyoncé so do it like beyond
Do it like Beyoncé and put it on Sean
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma I'ma, hmm, hmm, like it's my last
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at all, all, all, all, all, all, all (Hey)
All, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Now I'ma fill this glass up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma blow this bag up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'ma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in space
All, all up in my face like, "You remember who I am?"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton shine
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the wonton
Rose rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rocking Sean John
Man, I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'ma just tell you, it's everything that I expected, bitch
Hands up in the air
(One time for the West Side, West Side let me see them hands)
Hands up in the air
(Two times if you love G.O.O.D Music)
Hands up in the air
(And three times for the baddest chick in the world)
(Who got her hands up in the air)
Hands up in the air
Now I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma I'ma, hmm, hmm, like it's my last
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at
All, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at
All, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I never had it at all
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be balling on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
'Cause if you don't do it big bitch you ain't doing nothing
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma I'ma, hmm, hmm, like it's my last
(Boi)
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at (D town)
All, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at
All, all, all, all, all, all, all
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at
All, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I never had it at all
